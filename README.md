# Music-Genre-Classification---Deep-Learning
Using Deep Learning Methods, we can use an End to End method (i.e. we can directly feed in wav files) to the deep neural network which will classify the song to 1 of 10 Genres from the GTZAN dataset.

We achieve a final accuracy of 86% and respectable accuracies for each individual genre. The model for this was based on ConflictNETL https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/60041
